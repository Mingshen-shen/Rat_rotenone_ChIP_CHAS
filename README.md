# Rat_rotenone_ChIP_CHAS
This is a project deconvolute the bulk H3K27ac data using CHAS,a deconvolution tool. So that we can determine which DARs were specific to individual cell types. Furthermore, this approach investigated cell typeâ€“specific gene regulatory changes and dysregulated pathways across the SN and motor cortex using GO analysis..
