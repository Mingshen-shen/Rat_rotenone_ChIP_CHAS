- Trim Galore (v0.6.10) — trimming  
- MultiQC (v1.15) — generating a summary report for all samples  
- Bowtie2 (v2.5.4) — alignment  
- Picard (v2.18.29) — removing duplicates

## 1. Cell Type-Specific Regulatory Landscapes
This subproject contains comprehensive cell type-specific enrichment analyses in a rat rotenone model of Parkinson’s disease (PD). The analyses integrate genomic, epigenomic, and statistical genetics approaches to identify which brain cell types show the strongest genetic contribution to PD pathogenesis.

### Aims
- To integrate cell type–specific H3K27ac enhancer landscapes from rat midbrain.
- To combine these enhancer annotations with Parkinson’s disease GWAS summary statistics.
- To quantify cell type–specific PD heritability enrichment using LD Score Regression (LDSC).

### Key Findings
- **Dopaminergic enhancers** show the strongest enrichment of PD heritability.  
- **Oligodendrocyte enhancers** display moderate to strong PD heritability enrichment.  
- Enhancer annotations for other two cell types exhibit lower or non-significant enrichment.  
- These results support a **multi–cell-type genetic architecture** underlying Parkinson’s disease risk.

## 2. Deconvolution analysis using CHAS
This subproject deconvolutes the same bulk H3K27ac data using CHAS, a deconvolution tool. So that we can determine which DARs were specific to individual cell types. Furthermore, this approach investigated cell type–specific gene regulatory changes and dysregulated pathways across the substantia nigra (SN) using GO analysis. 

### Aims
- To deconvolute a bulk H3K27ac ChIP-seq datasets using CHAS.
- To identify cell type–specific differentially acetylated regions (DARs) across the substantia nigra (SN).
- To investigate dysregulated gene regulatory pathways and biological processes through GO enrichment analysis.

### Key Findings
- **Oligodendrocytes** show a consistent pattern of **hypoacetylation** in the substantia nigra (SN).
- Hypoacetylated regions in oligodendrocytes are strongly associated with **myelin-related functions**, suggesting widespread disruption of oligodendroglial regulation.
- The possible reduction in microglia may be linked to **oxidative stress–induced apoptotic pathways**.
