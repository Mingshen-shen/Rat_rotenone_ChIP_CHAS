# Rat_rotenone_ChIP_CHAS
This is a project deconvolute the bulk H3K27ac data using CHAS,a deconvolution tool. So that we can determine which DARs were specific to individual cell types. Furthermore, this approach investigated cell type–specific gene regulatory changes and dysregulated pathways across the SN and motor cortex using GO analysis.. 

## Aims
The aims of this project are:
- To deconvolute a bulk H3K27ac ChIP-seq datasets using CHAS .
- To identify cell type–specific differentially acetylated regions (DARs) across the substantia nigra (SN).
- To investigate dysregulated gene regulatory pathways and biological processes through GO enrichment analysis.

## Data Access
The raw and processed data used in this project are stored within the laboratory’s internal servers and are not publicly available due to privacy and data-sharing restrictions.
