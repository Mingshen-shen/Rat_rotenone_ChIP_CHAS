# Rat_rotenone_ChIP_CHAS
This is a project deconvolute the bulk H3K27ac data using CHAS,a deconvolution tool. So that we can determine which DARs were specific to individual cell types. Furthermore, this approach investigated cell type–specific gene regulatory changes and dysregulated pathways across the SN and motor cortex using GO analysis.. 
##  Data Availability
Due to the large size of the dataset (~300 MB), the downstream analysis data including all the objects and values are hosted on **Zenodo**.

You can download the data from:
